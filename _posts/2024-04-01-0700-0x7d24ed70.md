"AI Art" by Joanna Zylinska. 2020. Open Humanities Press. ::: just finished reading this. it places selected AI art / artists in historical context and goes beyond the usual "can computers be creative?" questions. I particularly appreciated the final chapter on post-internet art. great reference list also!
