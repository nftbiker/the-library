An essential collection of Robert Smithson's key essays and interviews. This is art writing at its best, and at its most experimental, poetic, and conceptual. What to say other than these are my favourite pieces of writing by any artist, period.  
  
'Since the 1979 publication of The Writings of Robert Smithson, Robert Smithson's significance as a spokesman for a generation of artists has been widely acknowledged and the importance of his thinking to contemporary artists and art critics continues to grow. The Collected Writings includes previously unpublished essays by Smithson and gathers hard-to-find articles, interviews, and photographs. Together these provide a full picture of his wide-ranging views on art and culture.'
