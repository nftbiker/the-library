Artist cookbook 'The Book of #veGAN' by Helena Sarin+Kate Ray with a foreword by Robbie Barrat. I think great artworks come from a place of true exploration in to the questions and interests an artist has. Often times artist make art about art and although it looks great it doesn't usually reveal any new territory.
