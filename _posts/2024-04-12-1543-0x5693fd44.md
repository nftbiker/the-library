Who has a book collecting problem and the unread pile grows faster than you can read? This is one of those books in my pile.

'The Language of Art - An approach to a theory of symbols'. The book is a systematic inquiry into the variations of symbols; letters/words/texts, pictures, diagrams, maps and models.
