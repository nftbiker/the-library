THE AUDIOVISUAL BREAKTHROUGH   
(edited by: Ana Carvalho, Cornelia Lund, 2015)  
PDF:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337486988_THE_AUDIOVISUAL_BREAKTHROUGH  
.  
"Visual music, expanded cinema, live cinema, VJing, live audiovisual performance—these are concepts enough to create some confusion in the wide realm of today’s artistic audiovisual production. While each of these concepts is widely propagated and suggestive of its own line of history and shared practices, they are not as yet sufficiently defined for theoretical debate and clear practical use. To untangle this confusion was the aim of our project, The Audiovisual Breakthrough, which brought together six international researchers to solve the problem in a collaborative effort. This book is the result. Its main purpose is to make the entangled complexities of the field manageable by putting forth and elaborating on definitions for the five main concepts named above."
