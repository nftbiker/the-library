arti AbramoviÄ‡ + the Future of Performance Art (2010)
By: Maria Balshaw, Plymouth Arts
Publisher: Prestel

This book on the latest in contemporary performance art features the work of world-renowned artist Marina Abramovic and showcases eighteen emerging artists. Abramovic's remarkable career as one of her generation's most challenging performance artists, has paved the way for younger artists who are interested in this complex and often radical art form. Lately Abramovic has turned her attention to exploring ways to encapsulate the art form after the performance is physically completed. This project explores the diversity of contemporary performance art through the works of exciting new artists from around the world.
