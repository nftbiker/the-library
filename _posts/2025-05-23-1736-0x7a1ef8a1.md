I can't vouch for the content of this design journal (yet) but i can vouch for the cover.  
  
'Journal of the Ulm School for Design was published from 1958–1968 in 14 issues (21 numbers). This international journal provided a comprehensive account of the theoretical, rational and practical curriculum at one of Europe’s most influential design schools since the Bauhaus' - Monoskop  
  
PDF's of every issue can be found at good old Monoskop
