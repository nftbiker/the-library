'10 PRINT is a book about a one-line Commodore 64 BASIC program, published in 2012.   
  
Realising that @vortac's masterpiece in /geoblocks on Monday reminded me so much of the patterns in 10 PRINT, I wondered if anyone had added this book to the /the-library Hey, even if they did, here's the reminder :)
