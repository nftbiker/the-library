Fontana

- by Barbara Hess

"Fontana" by Barbara Hess is an insightful exploration of the life and work of Italian artist Lucio Fontana.
The book delves into Fontana's pioneering contributions to modern art, particularly his Spatialism movement, which sought to break the traditional boundaries of painting and sculpture.
Hess examines Fontana's famous "slashes" and "holes" in canvases, which challenged conventional notions of space and form. Through rich illustrations and thoughtful analysis, the book highlights Fontana's influence on contemporary art and his role in shaping avant-garde aesthetics.
