I love these 1970's Michael Whelan covers for Michael Moorcock's Elric series. No heroic hunks or buxom blondes, just weird and dark with a subtext of BDSM. Like the Elric character himself, obviously.

I read a few of these in my youth, Moorcock is an elegant writer and he's conjured up a rich dark mythology of anti-heroes and deals with forces best not named... Happy to say I own 3 of these paperbacks.
