Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists

- Casey Reas, Ben Fry, John Maeda

This book introduces computer programming for visual arts using the open-source Processing language, with thorough updates throughout.

This book, now in its second edition, is the first to deeply cover Processing 2.0 and 3.0. All examples have been updated, chapters revised, and new chapters added on data, geometry, and synthesis. Additional interviews explore a wider range of projects, and online "extension" chapters stay current with technological advancements.
