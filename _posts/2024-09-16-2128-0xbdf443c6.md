Ex-formation, Kenya Hara, 2015

Wisdom from a master of design. In contrast to information, ex-formation describes how little we really know and thus becomes the starting point for any type of design. Hara states: “What moves people’s hearts, in every case, is the unknown. Things that people already know don’t excite them.”
