The dystopian smart house in JG Ballard's The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista (collected in Vermilion Sands) plays back the emotive memories of its former owners to its new ones. It's Bachelard's Poetics of Space deformed. Rather than personally recalled, the poetics are transmitted by the resonant dysmorphia of villa's architectural features.
