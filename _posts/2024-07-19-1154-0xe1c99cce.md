Today, I'm sharing something a bit different with you:  
  
Free ebooks by Roma publications, presenting several projects of Dutch chalk artist Bart Lodewijks (a personal fav of mine, I already shared in /newmasters), to be found via: https://www.romapublications.org/Bart_Lodewijks_Library/index.html  
  
The books document the projects and feature write-ups by the artist, as well as beautiful minimalistic layouts and great images. I really enjoy reading and viewing these from time to time.  
  
Example covers are from his series "Noordereiland Drawings 2+3"
