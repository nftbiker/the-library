I Seem to Be a Verb, R. Buckminster Fuller, 1970

This rare paperback is an early visual example of the cacophony of the electronic age as captured by the dynamic duo of Jerome Agel and Quentin Fiore (who were also behind the design of McLuhanâ€™s The Medium is the Message). It is chaotic and captures a sense of a proto internet in the spirit of the Whole Earth Catalog.
