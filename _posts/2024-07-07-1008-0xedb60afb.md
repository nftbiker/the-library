In the 80s, a french law required motorway management companies to invest 0.1% of their turnover in cultural facilities. We therefore have many artworks visible on our roads in France, and Julien Lelièvre grouped them all together in a book called “Art d'autoroute" (Highway Art).
This book is in my wishlist :-)
