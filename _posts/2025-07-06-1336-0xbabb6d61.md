Rangoli's are where folk art, religious practices and generative processes meet. Kind of....  
  
The process for making these - exclusively by women and girls in front of their houses - is pretty much entirely procedural. These are from a Rangoli pattern book that I picked up in India more than 15 years ago. I have a dozen of these books and their print quality is gorgeous, perhaps riso'd.
