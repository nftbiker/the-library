Inspiration of the day #39

HARUCHIKA NOGUCHI - Order, spontaneity and the body

This days I'm reading a book about my other passion, medicine. I really like the approach of Noguchi, seitai and katsugen creator, about health and body and how to regulate ourselves dealing with surplus of energy that make us ill.
