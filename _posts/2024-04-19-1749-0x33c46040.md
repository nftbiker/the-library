Nancy Burson, a pioneer of synthetic photography, developed a system to fuse multiple images in to a new composite. One of her early explorations in the late 70's was the "aged" transformation, taking a photo of a person and predicting what they would look like later in life. Reminiscent of GANs but 35+ years before.
