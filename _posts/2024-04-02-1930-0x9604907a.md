Fine idea, this /the-library. Got infected, read one article about the context of asemic works by Mirtha Dermisache https://post.moma.org/on-language-and-its-limits-the-illegible-writings-of-mirtha-dermisache and then Asemic | the art of writing by Peter Schwenger. Kinda academic, but discovered unexpected connections.
