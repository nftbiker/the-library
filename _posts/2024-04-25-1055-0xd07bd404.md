Continuing the series of genart pioneers, today I'm sharing the work of Klaus Basset, born 1926 in Berlin, who is also known for his typewriter art.   
  
Since 1975 he worked together with the engineer Willi Plöchl to bring typewriter art to computer, resulting it the beautiful series Tarnräume “disguised spaces”.
