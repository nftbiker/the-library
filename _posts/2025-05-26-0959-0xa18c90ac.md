Electric Dreams: Art and Technology Before the Internet â€“ Tate Catalogue, 2024

I would say a fairly essential edition to the library of anyone interested generative art, optical, kinetic and programmed art. I enjoyed the show, which which drew a wide arc and gave some lesser known figures and movements the recognition they deserved. The (permutational) poet and calligrapher Brion Gysin was one and the movement/magazine Radical Software being another.

As usual some more impressions below.
