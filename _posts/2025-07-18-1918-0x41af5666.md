Wendit Tnce Inf is a book of asemic prose poems, published in a hand-made letterpress-printed edition. To generate the poems, Allison trained a suite of GANs (generative adversarial networks) on bitmap images of random words, and sampled from those GANs to generate new wordforms, pixel-by-pixel. A separate program she wrote then places these words on the page, one after another, line by line, mimicking the process of typesetting English prose.
