Where to start with the library...darktaxa physically stands out in my collection at 1000 pages with an imposing naked sewn spine. I was drawn to the book because two artists I respect (Anna Ridler and David Young) are part of the collective. https://diamondhollowbooks.com/product/darktaxa-project-nopublication-11-2021
