Performance and Cultural Politics (Routledge)  
Editor: Elin Diamond  
Publisher: Routledge  
  
Performance and Cultural Politics is a groundbreaking collection of essays which explore the historical and cultural territories of performance, written by the foremost scholars in the field. The essays, exploring performance art, theatre, music and dance, range from Oscar Wilde to Eric Clapton; from the Rose Theatre to U.S. Holocaust museums. The topic includes:  
* Sex Play: Stereotype, Pose and Dildo  
* Grave Performances: The Cultural Politics of Memory  
* Genealogies: Critical Performances  
* Identity Politics: Passing, Carnival and the Law  
In the concluding section, `Performer's Performance', performance artist Robbie McCauley offers the practitioner's perspective on performance studies.  
Interdisciplinary, thought-provoking and rich in new ideas, Performance and Cultural Politics is a landmark in the emerging field of performance studies.
