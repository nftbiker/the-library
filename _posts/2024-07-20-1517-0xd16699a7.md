Sharing another website today I consult frequently for graphic design inspiration. It is not a book ðŸ«£, but (at least) a website about books and magazines.

https://designreviewed.com/

Design Reviewed is a personal project of Matt Lamont, dedicated to digitally preserving graphic design history and documenting the vast visual culture from the last century.

His collection might be unrivaled anywhere in the world.
