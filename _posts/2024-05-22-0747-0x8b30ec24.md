Eduardo Paolozzi - Whitechapel Gallery, 2017  
  
Everthing this artist touched turned to gold. The range of different mediums he worked with is quite staggering, be it sculpture, painting, drawing, print making, collage or silk screen.  
  
Though most known for his sculptures, I'm crazy about his screen prints. ↓↓↓
