I have a huge crush on these covers from the most recent Penguin Classics Science Fiction collection (2021). Those that I've read are really some of the finest of the genre, Lem's Cyberiad, Ana Kavan's Ice, the Stapledon, the Lovecraft and of course Abbot's Flatland. These covers make me want to fill the gaps.... I am not a huge Sci-fi fan but I like to dabble ;) Can anyone recommend any here?
