Angry Women (1991)  
Andrea Juno, V. Vale  
  
"16 cutting-edge performance artists discuss a wide range of topics - from menstruation, masturbation, vibrators, S&M and spanking to racism, failed Utopias and the death of the Sixties. Armed with total contempt for dogma, stereotype and cliche, these creative visionaries probe deep into our social foundation of taboos, beliefs and totalitarian linguistic contradictions from which spring (as well as thwart) our theories, imaginings, behaviour and dreams."
