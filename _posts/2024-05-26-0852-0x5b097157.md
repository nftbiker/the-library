AUDIO-VISION Sound on Screen
(Michel Chion 1994)
.
"Sound in av media does not merely complement images. Instead, the two channels together engage audio-vision, a special mode of perception that transforms both seeing and hearing. We don’t see images and hear sounds separately—we audio-view a trans-sensory whole."
