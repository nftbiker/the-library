Blast from the past: Old RPG rulebooks and modules from my teens... I was reminded of my years playing AD&D and tabletop RPGs by @sinusoidalsnail posting an old magazine I used to own.  
  
That 1986 "Gamma World" is a deep cut, a proper TSR release but I could never find more materials for it. "Cyberpunk" (1988) was cool as hell, though. ðŸ˜Ž
