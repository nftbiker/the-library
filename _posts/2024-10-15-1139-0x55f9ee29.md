Not exactly a book, but my phd thesis on the Relationships between the Sound, Visual and Movement in Interactive Systems.   
PDF here:https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/116201/2/293185.pdf  
  
Most of it can be a bit boring ðŸ˜… . But I guess that the "historical background" and "state of the art sections" can be interesting to check for anyone interested in computer & generative art / interactive art / new media / ....  
You will also recognise probably many artists& artworks, like @mariuswatz "sound memory" (in the right page bellow) :) :)
