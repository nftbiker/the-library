Patterns in Nature

- by Peter S. Stevens

"Patterns in Nature" by Peter S. Stevens is an engaging exploration of the mathematical and geometric patterns found in the natural world. The book delves into the recurring shapes and structures that appear in various natural phenomena, from the spirals of shells and galaxies to the branching of trees and rivers.
Stevens explains how these patterns arise from fundamental physical and biological processes, making complex concepts accessible to a broad audience. Richly illustrated, the book not only highlights the beauty of these natural patterns but also provides a deeper understanding of the underlying principles that govern the natural world.
