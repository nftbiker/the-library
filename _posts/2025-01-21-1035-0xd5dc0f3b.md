Art + DIY Electronics
(Garnet Hertz, 2023)
PDF Book: https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5589/Art-DIY-Electronics
.
"A systematic theory of DIY electronic culture, drawn from a century of artists who have independently built creative technologies.

Since the rise of Arduino and 3D printing in the mid-2000s, do-it-yourself approaches to the creative exploration of technology have surged in popularity. But the maker movement is not new: it is a historically significant practice in contemporary art and design. This book documents, tracks, and identifies a hundred years of innovative DIY technology practices, illustrating how the maker movement is a continuation of a long-standing creative electronic subculture.
