A personal favorite from /the-library

"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" by Edward R. Tufte (self-published 2nd edition)

Standard work about statistical and data graphics, featuring:

- an overview of the practice of the last two centuries,
- providing a universal language and
- tons of practical theory
