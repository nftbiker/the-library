Four color plates from Wilhelm Ostwald’s ‘Theory of Colour’. 1930.  
  
Ostwald explained his theory of color in a series of lectures at the Bauhaus Dessau in 1926 & 1927 and spoke at the World Congress of Advertising in Berlin in 1929.   
  
The color plates are from the book he wrote two years before his death.
