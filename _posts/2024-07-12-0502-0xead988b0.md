ERATO + RETURNER | Louis T. Milic, Aleator Press

Perfect facsimiles of very early computer generated poetry.

'Though preceded at least by Jean A. Baudot’s La machine à écrire (1964), Manfred Krause and Götz F. Schaudt's Computer-Lyrik (1967), and Alison Knowles and James Tenney’s A House of Dust (c. 1968), Louis T. Milic’s Program ERATO (1971) was likely the first volume of computer poetry published in the United States. Further contributing to its intrigue is Milic’s status as an important apologist for computer poetry, and the most prominent scholar and critic of the form writing in English in its first two decades' – Aleator Press
