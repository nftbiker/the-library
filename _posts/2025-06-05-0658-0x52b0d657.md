Apollo 11 Timeline Book.   
Houston Manned Spacecraft Center, Flight Planning Branch, 19 June-12 July 1969.  
  
The three-ringed document covers the Eagle's voyage from inspection to its undocking, descent, ascent, and rendezvous with the Apollo 11 Command Module. More impressions in comments.  
  
NASA has scans of the Apollo 12, 14 and 16 Timeline Books but I havenâ€™t yet tracked a scan of this one.
