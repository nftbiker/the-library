ðŸ§µ - 'World Receivers'

Before Kandinsky, in the 19th century, Georgiana Houghton + Hilma af Klint developed their own abstract visual language. Emma Kunz followed in the 20th century.

All three strove to visualize the laws of nature, the spiritual, & the supernatural. None were recognized during their lifetimes.
