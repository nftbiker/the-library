Google Volume 2, Felix Heyes & Ben West, 2024  
  
Google Images is the largest image search engine on the internet. According to its guiding principles, the search engine should display the most relevant images for searches. Ten years ago, Felix Heyes and Ben West put this to the test.  
  
In their book Google Volume 1 (2013), they replaced the 21,110 words and their meanings in the English Pocket Dictionary with the first image that appeared when the word was searched for on Google Images. Ten years later, the same 21,110 words have once again been run through the search engine.
