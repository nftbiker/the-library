Manfred Mohr â€žVom Rhythmus zum Algorithmusâ€œ (From Rhythm to Algorithm), German/English edition, Modo 2017

Exhibition catalogue â€“ the book was published on the occasion of the self-titled retrospective exhibition (spanning roughly 5 decades) in Mohrâ€™s city of birth, Pforzheim (South-West Germany)

The title gives a hint on Mohrâ€™s artistic background as well as his artistic development from a Tachysm/Hard-Edge painter to an early artist working with the computer and algorithms. But also from being a sought-after jazz musician to becoming a full-time visual artist and a pioneer of digital art.

A ðŸ§µ â€” 1/4
