Nature Printing 👁️‍🗨️ 🍀   
  
'Nature printing is a printing process, developed in the 18th century, that uses the plants, animals, rocks and other natural subjects to produce an image. The subject undergoes several stages to give a direct impression onto materials such as lead, gum, and photographic plates, which are then used in the printing process. ' - wiki  
  
The most exquisite example of this technique can be found in Henry Bradbury's book The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland.
