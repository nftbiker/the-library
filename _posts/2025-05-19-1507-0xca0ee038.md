The Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments  
John C. Lilly, 1974  
  
Lysergic 'metaprogramming' and behavioural hacking with psychonaut John C. Lilly. A vapourware of altered states double-dipped in cybernetics and programmatic paradigms (which are used to describe consciousness). Perhaps for *some of you* the cover only.
