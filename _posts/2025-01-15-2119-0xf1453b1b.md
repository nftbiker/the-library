I don't quite understand how it is possible given the challenges of translation â€” however, these books have left quite an impression on me. Balle's use of language truly feels like a realtime render engine that slowly adds detail and clarity that unfolds like origami in my mind. A bizarrely palpable experience. And gotta love these covers. Gorgeous!
