across & beyond: A transmediale Reader on Post-digital Practices, Concepts, and Institutions (2017)

A series of short essays from artists and theorists (such as Rosa Menkman and Benjamin Bratton) that explore the concept of "post digital" as a way of looking "across and beyond" the field of media art. This is a fun one to dip into during a coffee break (as an alternative to doomscrolling on Farcaster ;)!
