The book “Brasília, the art of democracy” is available for free download in PDF. It's an honor to be featured in this book alongside so many incredible artists whom I admire so much.

About the book:
The 400-page publication investigates the historical, political and symbolic aspects surrounding the creation and meaning of the city of Brasília, the federal capital of Brazil, which recently celebrated its 65th anniversary.

More than half of the book is dedicated to an interpretation of the city from the perspective of the arts, featuring a wealth of images, interviews and critical texts on works by: Rosângela Rennó, Cildo Meireles, Maria Martins, Rubem Valentim, Bené Fonteles, Frans Krajcberg, Siron Franco, Volpi, Grupo Poro (Brígida Campbell + Marcelo Terça-Nada), Daiara Tukano, Gê Orthof, Jonathas de Andrade, among many others.
