I will be doing more with Artletter this year.  
  
Artletter = The Arts  
  
Short-form and long-form posts involving:  
  
• Music  
• Visual arts  
• Personal philosophies and lessons I’ve gained through or in connection to the arts  
• Updates and insights into my personal creative projects  
• Literary, applied, etc.  
  
I’m fascinated with both the universal and the granular.  
  
As much as I enjoy sharing these things on social media platforms like this one, posts easily get lost in the timeline.  
  
Artletter removes the noise (while sharing the beauty of noise).  
  
Artletter is a calm and clean place (where you learn about the radical).  
  
Artletter goes straight to your inbox. It’s like an automatic bookmarking service. No noise. No worries about missing anything. No searching. It just calmly waits there for whenever you want to open it.   
  
Artletter simply feels better.   
  
Join me as I explore and share the intersection of art, thought, and practice.
