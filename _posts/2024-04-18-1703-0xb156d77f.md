'Atlas of Anomalous AI' edited by Ben Vickers and K Allado-McDowell is like no other 'AI' book I've read; which all seem to hover around the ideas of creativity, technology and the potential pros/cons. This book dives deeper into historical perspectives on our relationship with knowledge and intelligence.
