Inspired by @aaraalto book posts, I would like to share a book, that is not available to buy as such, as it was part of an exhibition at the Design Museum in London.   
  
At the exhibition, you could collect pages for some of the exhibits and then compile them into a book.   
  
The exhibition, curated by designers Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, was a study of everyday objects left in a random state of production.   
  
I will link to an article discussing the exhibition in detail.
