Peter Mendelsund   
What We See When We Read (Vintage Original): A Phenomenology, 2014  
  
'What do we see when we read? Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like? The collection of fragmented images on a page—a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so—and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved—or reviled—literary figures.'  
  
This is a fun book about abstraction, perception, visualisation, and the ways in which we construct meaning and mental models from reading works of literature.
