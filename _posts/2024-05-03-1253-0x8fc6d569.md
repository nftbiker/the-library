iâ€™m about 1/4 through this book, â€˜Why Art Criticism?: A Readerâ€™ and been really enjoying it so far!  
  
40+ source texts of art criticism that span 4 centuries and multiple continents. A huge wealth of knowledge for me on how critics have historically used criticism as activism, judgement, historicisation, etc.
