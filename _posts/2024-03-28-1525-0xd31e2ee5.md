A brilliant, original book on the thinking and methods of generative artist, Matteo Mauro, by the author himself.

He gives us granular analysis and lessons on the ornamentation of the the Rococo genre of the 18th century and finishes with its influence on his code-based generative art.

A couple pages in threadðŸ‘‡
