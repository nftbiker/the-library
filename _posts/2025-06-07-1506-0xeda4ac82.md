Paolo Zellini  
The Mathematics of the Gods and the Algorithms of Men: A Cultural History, 2016  
  
Can't vouch for this one as only just picked it up. A scan through the contents (see other photo below), and a quick read of some paragraphs for style was enough for me to take the plunge on it.  
  
'Mathematician and philosopher Paolo Zellini offers a brief cultural and intellectual history of mathematics, ranging widely from the paradoxes of ancient Greece to the sacred altars of India, from Mesopotamian calculus to our own contemporary obsession with algorithms'
