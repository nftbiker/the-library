Last week was special because we received the prototype of our First Issue of SeekeR   
  
And we're SHOCKED by the print quality !!!  
  
It's a prototype. It still needs cutting, laminating, binding, etc.  
But this preview makes us more than confident in the level of piece we want to present 📖 🖼️
