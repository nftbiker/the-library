VIDEO ART  
Author: Syvia Martin  
Publisher: Taschen  
  
This book is part of the Basic Art series in the Taschen collection. I translated it into Persian in 2014, around the time I began to practically experience video art.   
  
The book contains a brief history of video art and its emergence in the 1960s. It also introduces key artists of this medium and their artworks. The information is both brief and comprehensive, which I really like.
