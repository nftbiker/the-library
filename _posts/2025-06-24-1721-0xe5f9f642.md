One of the more esoteric books in my library is MCV which i picked up from The Library of Babel thanks to Christian Bök.  
  
'Christian Bök has rediscovered volumes in the hexagonal tenements of the Library of Babel. The ﬁve books conform to the speciﬁcations described by Borges: 410 pages, with 40 lines of text per page and with 80 characters of text per line. Each of the original editions has appeared in print, limited to 25 copies for sale, after which the books have vanished forever.'   
  
I am happy to own one of the few physical copies Christian made of MCV. I also like that MCV suggests to me MVC (Model View Controller), the well-known software and programming pattern.  
  
Digital copies of the 5 books can be found here.
