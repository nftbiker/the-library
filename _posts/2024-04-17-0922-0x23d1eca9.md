GM, today i'm doing some archeology in the internet, trying to exhume the processing sketches from Jean-noÃ«l Lafargue. They are nice to look at and to learn from.  
I really hope his book "<=280" which include them will be re-published. Until then, i'm building my personal archive of it by digging hard :-)
