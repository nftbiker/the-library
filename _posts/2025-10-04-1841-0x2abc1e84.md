Print Punch: Artefacts From The Punch Card Era - by Steven E Jones, Sandra Rendgen and John L Walters  
  
"Print Punch returns to the heyday of the punch card â€” to a time when you could touch (and punch) data. The aesthetics of this early move towards automation represent a unique moment in our history, when we designed for machines instead of human beings.   
  
Rigorous constraints, inherent in punch card technology, unwittingly birthed a coherent design language: rhythm in grids, punched absences and presences, and the patterns in them dancing to their own machine logic."
