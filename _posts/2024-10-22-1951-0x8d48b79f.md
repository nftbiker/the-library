Inspired by @vortac Ed Templeton's book, I'll share an artist from the Mission School, Chris Johanson. I gravitate towards Johanson's balance of figurative/abstraction and storytelling with an honest compassion and eye for the humanity around him. It's a prize possession because of the fun title page painting.
