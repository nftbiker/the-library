Thrilled to announce that 3 of my video-performances have been published in THE 1ST AFA COLLECTION.  
This book is available on Amazon.  
  
  
The present book is a comprehensive collection from the inaugural AFA Awards annual event, featuring new media works by contemporary Iranian artists. The AFA Awards aim to collect and showcase digital artworks created by innovative new-generation artists from the Middle East.  
Storia Editions try to present each annual edition as a separate volume for all contemporary art enthusiasts and the general audience.
