Grammar of Ornament by Owen Jones. First published in 1856, it's full of motifs and patterns from such varied sources (Pompeian, "savage tribes", Persian, Indian, Islamic etc). Jones was an architect and designer and he made this to encourage young designers to take inspiration from historical design principles.
