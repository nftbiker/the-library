Rosaire Appel  
Voices Pending, 2023  
  
I've been collecting Rosaire Appel's affordable artist books for some time and love her work. She specialises in a lively take on asemic writing and comic book abstraction.  
  
***  
  
'Voices Pending is a full-color anthology of abstract comics by Rosaire Appel. Comics imply talk, not only noise-talk but silences and gestures. Combinations of reading and looking create an inherent tension even in traditional comics, and talk, as it moves through rooms and country-sides is sequential. But: understanding is a moving target.  
  
Rosaire Appel lives and works in New York. Her field is abstract visual language. She writes: "I bridge the gap between verbal writing and its visual counterparts through non-symbolic mark-making and asemic writing. Asemic writing looks like writing but has no semantic value. It is ancient as well as contemporary. '  
  
More impressions in the comments.
