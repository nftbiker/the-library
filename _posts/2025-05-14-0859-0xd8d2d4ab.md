HOLO 3  
Mirror Stage: Between Computability and Its Opposite, 2021  
  
This one arrived at the bunker on Saturday and I am nearly half way through. Considering it is nearly 4 years old, much of the writing - philosophical in tone but journalistic in style - is still vital. The design and layout are spectacular.  (â†“ for more impressions)  
  
'Guest editor Nora N. Khan and fifteen luminaries question our problematic faith in and deference to AI. Exploring the limits of knowledge, prediction, language, and abstraction in computation, their collected essays and artworks measure the gap between machine learning hypotheticals and the mess of lived experience.'
