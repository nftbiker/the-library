Protocol: How Control Exists after Decentralization  
By Alexander R. Galloway (2004)  
  
Twenty years since its release, this book feels more relevant than ever. The final chapter on Internet Art (1995-99) describes etoy.com's early attempts to tokenise and sell shares in art collectives, (pre-blockchain) auctions of websites as publicly accessible historical artefacts, and the cultural significance of net. art pioneers such as JODI.
