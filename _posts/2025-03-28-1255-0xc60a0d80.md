Finally getting around to reading this one, now 13 years old! I am enjoying its fresh and varied approach, despite its age. Love the chapter on Perec's Thinking Machines.  
  
Mainframe Experimentalism - Hannah Higgins & Douglas Kahn, Eds. 2012  
  
'Mainframe Experimentalism challenges the conventional wisdom that the digital arts arose out of Silicon Valleyâ€™s technological revolutions in the 1970s. In fact, in the 1960s, a diverse array of artists, musicians, poets, writers, and filmmakers around the world were engaging with mainframe and mini-computers to create innovative new artworks that contradict the stereotypes of "computer art."'
