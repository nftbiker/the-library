SPEAK DATA Artists, Scientists, Thinkers, and Dreamers on How We Live Our Lives in Numbers ( by Giorgia Lupi and Phillip Cox, 2025)  
https://giorgialupi.com/publications  
  
"SPEAK DATA brings together years of thinking around data as a language. Not just a tool for measurement, but a way to understand who we are, how we connect, and how we make sense of the world.⁣⁣ It’s about what becomes visible when we stop treating data as cold and distant, and instead use it to ask questions and tell stories that are deeply human.⁣⁣ "
