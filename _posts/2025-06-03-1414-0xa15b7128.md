I’ve just started reading A Brief History of Intelligence by Max Bennett.  
Right from the first pages, the book raises an interesting question: what truly defines intelligence?  
Not just artificial, but human — this complex mix of creativity, adaptation, and learning.  
I’m curious to see how the author connects all of this to the future of machines (and ours).
