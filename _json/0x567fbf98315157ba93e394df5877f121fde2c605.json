  "text": "\"Artificial Aesthetics: Generative AI, Art and Visual Media\"\nManovich, L., & Arielli, E. (2024)\n.\nBook PDF: https://manovich.net/index.php/projects/artificial-aesthetics\n.\n\"The book explores how generative AI is transforming our understanding of aesthetics, creativity, design, and art appreciation. It uses approaches from six fields. Emanuele brings perspectives from aesthetics, philosophy of art, and psychology of art. Lev contributes perspectives from media theory, digital culture studies, and computer science, as well as his four decades of experience as an artist creating digital media, including recent work with generative AI. This is the first time all these different perspectives have been combined to analyze cultural AI.\"",
