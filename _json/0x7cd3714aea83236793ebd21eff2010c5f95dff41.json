  "text": "Now-Time – Issue 1: A Whirlpool in the River of Becoming, 2025\n\nNow-Time is a research and publishing project coordinating a multiplicity of historical lines oriented towards present activity. We aim to relink design, critical consciousness, and social-historical perspective. With collaborators we create new works that move through the maze of what has been, and transform those old works that speak indirectly but lucidly to the present situation.",
