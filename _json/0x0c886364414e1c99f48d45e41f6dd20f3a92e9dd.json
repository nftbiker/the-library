He is still regarded by his peers as a pioneer and innovative thinker, as evidenced by his own writings and his activities as an educator and photographer. The time has come to reassess his contributions to his professional field, in the context of a major technological shift from analog to digital typography between the 1980s and 2000s. Twenty years after his untimely death, his work is now ready to be rediscovered by a new generation of type and graphic designers. \n \nThis exhibition is the first result of a six-year preliminary research phase, which involved collecting and creating original archives from documents and interviews conducted in three countries with Bloemsma's relatives and colleagues. A monograph is planned for publication in 2027.",
