  "text": "In Other Los Angeleses: Multicentric Performance Art (2002) \nBy: Meiling Cheng\nPublisher:University of California Press\n\nA marginal artistic pursuit by choice as well as necessity, performance art has flourished in and about \"multicentric\" Los Angeles for nearly four decades, finding its own centers of activity, moving and changing as the margins have reconstituted themselves. The notion of multicentricity serves, somewhat paradoxically, as the unifying motif in Cheng's imaginative views of center and periphery, self and other, and \"mainstream\" and \"marginal\" cultures. She analyzes individual artists and performances in detail, bringing her own \"center\" gracefully and unmistakably into contact with all those others. Without suggesting that her approach is definitive, she offers a way of thinking and talking coherently about particularly elusive, ephemeral artwork.\n\n\nSource: Publisher",
