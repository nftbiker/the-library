  "text": "I will be doing more with Artletter this year.\n\nArtletter = The Arts\n\nShort-form and long-form posts involving:\n\n• Music\n• Visual arts\n• Personal philosophies and lessons I’ve gained through or in connection to the arts\n• Updates and insights into my personal creative projects\n• Literary, applied, etc.\n\nI’m fascinated with both the universal and the granular.\n\nAs much as I enjoy sharing these things on social media platforms like this one, posts easily get lost in the timeline.\n\nArtletter removes the noise (while sharing the beauty of noise).\n\nArtletter is a calm and clean place (where you learn about the radical).\n\nArtletter goes straight to your inbox. It’s like an automatic bookmarking service. No noise. No worries about missing anything. No searching. It just calmly waits there for whenever you want to open it. \n\nArtletter simply feels better. \n\nJoin me as I explore and share the intersection of art, thought, and practice.\nhttps://lonewick.substack.com/",
