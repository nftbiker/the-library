  "text": "Tactical Publishing: Using Senses, Software, and Archives in the Twenty-First Century (Alessandro Ludovico, 2024)\n.\nOpen Access: https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5716/Tactical-PublishingUsing-Senses-Software-and\n.\n\" In Tactical Publishing, a sequel to Post-Digital Print, Alessandro Ludovico explores the forces driving this historical phase, highlighting the tremendous opportunities it presents. Our task, he believes, is to develop an alternative publishing system that transcends the dichotomy between paper and digital media. He focuses first on the two activities on which publishing is premised—reading and writing (with an emphasis onwriting machines and post-truth in the latter)—and then deconstructs the concept, proposing alternative strategies inspired by recent practices and unconventional uses of technology.\"",
