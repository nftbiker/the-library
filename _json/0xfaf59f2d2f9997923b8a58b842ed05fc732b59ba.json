  "text": "\"Aesthetics Imperfections:How AI is changing the Landscape of Typography|\" (Gianpaolo Tucci, 2023)\nhttps://www.slanted.de/aesthetics-imperfections/\n\n\"... This is not a book on typography, but the expression of a point of view, a practical guide, and an investigation on how the integration and ethical use of artificial intelligence will play a fundamental role in modeling this future. This book witnesses the birth of a co-creation era, urging a rethinking to craft a more human-centric future where AI magnifies human creativity, rather than replacing it. Take a breath, and as if we were unaware laboratory animals, Tucci invites to jump into this journey made of confused, blurred, anatomical, radical, colorful, and sometimes overturned visions.\"",
