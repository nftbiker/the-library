  "text": "Performing Arts in Prisons\nCreative Perspectives (2019)\n\nEditors:Brydie-Leigh Bartleet, Huib Schippers, John Rynne, Linda Davey, Michael Balfour\n\nPublisher:Intellect Books\n\nAcross the world, performing arts programmes are increasing in number, scope and professionalism. They attract increasing academic and media attention. Theoretical and applied research, organizational evaluation reports, documentary films and journalism are detailing prison arts and creating recognition that this body of work is becoming a valued part of the correctional enterprise. There is a growing body of evidence that suggests music, theatre, poetry and dance can contribute to prisoner wellbeing, management, rehabilitation and reintegration. Performing Arts in Prisons: Creative Perspectives explores prison arts in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Chile, and creates a new framework for understanding its practices.\n\nSource: Publisher",
