  "text": "Art and the Future: A History/prophecy of the Collaboration Between Science, Technology, and Art\nDouglas Davis, 1973\n\nPossibly the oldest book in my collection surveying art's collaboration with science and technology. A critical examination of a broad remit of works, including Futurism, Constructivism, Op-Art, Kinetic sculpture, Technological Theater, Auto-Destructive Art, Environmental Systems, Video Art, Computer Film  and Conceptual Art.\n\nIt's interesting in this book to see which artists fell by the wayside of fashion, and those that survived its natural selection, some of whom are still practising today.\n\n↓↓↓ For more impressions",
