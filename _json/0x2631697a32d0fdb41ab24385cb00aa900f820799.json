  "text": "I will always remain critical of the hyper woo woo woo type of in-your-face marketing because it all stems from greed and pride and proliferates into a form that breeds envy and jealous, echo’d into an abyss of endless product. \n\nPre-COVID Web3 2017 did not have hyper-tokenization or “Real world assets” fruit stands with apes banging chests how great their outsourced artwork aided by a layer sorting script was on a loud tribal level. \n\nAlso the noise of developers is amplified much further than the traditional artist’s labor can keep up.\n\nDespite having no training the technocrat feels he can compete, with an untrained eye, more capital, and more speed, soulless AI work spreads like wildfire.\n\nI have a very strong disdain for the hyper woo woo woo, because the addition of crypto and decentralized storage should not pair with humans adapting and humanizing the tools haphazardly into their personality solely to sell clogs of data in the IPFS/Arweave that will be forgotten faster than a one-hit wonder.",
