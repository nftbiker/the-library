  "text": "Eduardo Paolozzi - Whitechapel Gallery, 2017\n\nEverthing this artist touched turned to gold. The range of different mediums he worked with is quite staggering, be it sculpture, painting, drawing, print making, collage or silk screen.\n\nThough most known for his sculptures, I'm crazy about his screen prints. ↓↓↓",
