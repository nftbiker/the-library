  "text": "\"From ASCII Art to Comic Sans: Typography and Popular Culture in the Digital Age\" (Karin Wagner, 2013)\n\nPDF BOOK: https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/5649/From-ASCII-Art-to-Comic-SansTypography-and-Popular\n\n\"A fresh and provocative take on typography, computing, and popular culture, viewed through four idiosyncratic typographical phenomena from the digital age.\n\nFrom ASCII Art to Comic Sans offers an original vision of the history of typography and computing in the digital age, viewed through the lens of offbeat typography. We often regard text as pure information and typography as a transparent art form without meaning of its own. In this richly illustrated book, however, Karin Wagner offers a fresh perspective that shows how text is always an image that conveys meaning, and how typography, far from being meaningless, has in fact shaped modern visual and material culture in significant ways.\"",
