  "text": "Surrealismus\n-by Cathrin Klingsöhr-Leroy\n\nThe book explores Surrealism's origins, key figures, and artistic philosophy, emphasizing its revolutionary approach to creativity, dream imagery, and the unconscious mind. It highlights the works of major artists like Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, Max Ernst, and André Breton, discussing how they broke with conventional artistic norms to create art that was fantastical, bizarre, and rooted in the exploration of the human psyche.",
