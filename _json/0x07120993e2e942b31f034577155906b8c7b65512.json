  "text": "Donna J. Haraway \"Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Cthulucene\"  an excellent book. Haraway is a key writer for ecology, the anthropocene, caring for non-human species as kin, interconnections: everything is connected to some thing (Thom van Dooren, Deborah Bird Rose). I think everyone should read this one",
