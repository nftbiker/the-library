  "text": "VIDEO ART\nAuthor: Syvia Martin\nPublisher: Taschen\n\nThis book is part of the Basic Art series in the Taschen collection. I translated it into Persian in 2014, around the time I began to practically experience video art. \n\nThe book contains a brief history of video art and its emergence in the 1960s. It also introduces key artists of this medium and their artworks. The information is both brief and comprehensive, which I really like.",
