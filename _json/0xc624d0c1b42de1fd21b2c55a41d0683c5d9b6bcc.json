  "text": "PARALLAX: Conspiracy Theories, Details, and the Act of Looking Closely\nEllie Wyatt, 2023\n\n'Parallax is an expansive exploration of the complex relationships between (un) truth, vision, and technology. Through a curated series of texts and visual works, Ellie Wyatt investigates how conspiracy theories are facilitated by urgent technological advances, the legacies of detailed modes of sight, and the circle as a magical and scientific tool.'\n\nAnother book on the 'to read' pile, but I think it may be interesting to a few people. Also a nice format with some edgy layout in parts.\n\nAs usual, more impressions + contents page images in comment.",
