  "text": "I finally finished this book. I took several pauses. It's sometimes a profound read, especially when the exchange between the two authors inevitably turns to the grief over Nick's loss (this book was conceived not long after Nick lost his son).\nBut last night, when I read the last pages and put it down, I said to myself: this is truly a great book. I took a lot from itâ€”about art, about grief, yes... about life.\nIt's probably more suitable for those who, in one way or another, have followed Nick's music career, but I still find it a good read even for someone who usually doesn't listen to his music.",
