  "text": "The Dream Machine, M. Mitchell Waldrop, 2018\n\nInstant hit from Stripe Press featuring the story of the man who instigated the work that led to the internet—and shifted our understanding of what computers could be. It includes the original texts of Licklider’s three most influential writings: “Man-Computer Symbiosis” (1960), which outlines the vision that led to the personal computer revolution of the 1970s; his “Intergalactic Network” memo (1963), which outlines the vision that inspired the internet; and “The Computer as a Communication Device” (1968, coauthored with Robert Taylor), which amplifies his vision for what the network could become.",
