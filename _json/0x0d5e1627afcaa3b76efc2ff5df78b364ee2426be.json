  "text": "THINGS I HAVE LEARNED IN MY LIFE SO FAR (Stefan Sagmeister, 2008)\n\n\"This book began as a list designer Stefan Sagmeister made in his diary under the title Things I have learned in my life so far, which includes statements such as \"Worrying solves nothing\" and \"Trying to look good limits my life.\" The list reveals something that is profoundly true: Although human beings have been pursuing happiness for countless generations, it is not so easily achieved. And we need constant reminders to keep us on the right path.\n.\nThis book consists of 15 unbound signatures in a laser-cut slipcase. Shuffling the sequence of the signatures will produce 15 different covers.\"",
