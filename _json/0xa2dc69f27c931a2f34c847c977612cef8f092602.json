Abramovic's remarkable career as one of her generation's most challenging performance artists, has paved the way for younger artists who are interested in this complex and often radical art form. Lately Abramovic has turned her attention to exploring ways to encapsulate the art form after the performance is physically completed. This project explores the diversity of contemporary performance art through the works of exciting new artists from around the world. \n\nSource: Publisher",
