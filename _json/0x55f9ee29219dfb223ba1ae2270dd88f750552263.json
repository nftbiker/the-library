  "text": "Not exactly a book, but my phd thesis on the Relationships between the Sound, Visual and Movement in Interactive Systems. \nPDF here:https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/116201/2/293185.pdf\n\nMost of it can be a bit boring ðŸ˜… . But I guess that the \"historical background\" and \"state of the art sections\" can be interesting to check for anyone interested in computer & generative art / interactive art / new media / ....\nYou will also recognise probably many artists& artworks, like @mariuswatz \"sound memory\" (in the right page bellow) :) :)",
