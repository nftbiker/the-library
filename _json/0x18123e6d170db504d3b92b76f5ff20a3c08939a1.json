  "text": "The Stone Tape: Posters 2001 - 2023 - Rob Churn, 2023\n\nA wonderful compendium of Rob Churns poster and flyer work, with a highly expressive illustration style that morphs between the whimsical and the art brutish - with skewed quotations of art classics in a beautiful Risograph finish. Love this book.",
