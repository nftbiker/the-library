  "text": "\"Computational Drawing\" by Carl Lostritto http://lostritto.com/book\nThis is currently my favourite genart book. It's a hard read from a Professor of Architecture, but is packed with deep insight and gorgeous plotted works. The chapter on depth perception is literally a compass for me right now.",
