  "text": "Rosaire Appel\nVoices Pending, 2023\n\nI've been collecting Rosaire Appel's affordable artist books for some time and love her work. She specialises in a lively take on asemic writing and comic book abstraction.\n\n***\n\n'Voices Pending is a full-color anthology of abstract comics by Rosaire Appel. Comics imply talk, not only noise-talk but silences and gestures. Combinations of reading and looking create an inherent tension even in traditional comics, and talk, as it moves through rooms and country-sides is sequential. But: understanding is a moving target.\n\nRosaire Appel lives and works in New York. Her field is abstract visual language. She writes: \"I bridge the gap between verbal writing and its visual counterparts through non-symbolic mark-making and asemic writing. Asemic writing looks like writing but has no semantic value. It is ancient as well as contemporary. '\n\nMore impressions in the comments.",
