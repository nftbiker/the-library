  "text": "The Great Pretender (2007)\nBy Theo Jansen\n\nFirstly, if you have not seen Theo Jansen's kinetic sculptures before, check out this video to see one in action as there is nothing I can write that will do them justice! \nüìΩÔ∏è: https://youtu.be/0Qdr5vZ5btU?si=VM-pqzGI3VwieOej\n\nThis book provides an comprehensive overview of how these creatures are created, starting as computer simulations and sketches and then being physically constructed, tested and iterated using yellow plastic tubes, string, zip ties and lots of ingenious engineering! \n\nThis is probably one of the most inspiring books I own. To me, Theo is a modern day Da Vinci, and I am endlessly fascinated by his work and his vision of creating dinosaur sized artificial lifeforms that roam beaches in the Netherlands! \n\nüìñ:  https://www.exploratoriumstore.com/products/theo-jansen-the-great-pretender\n\nYou can also find more about Theo's \"Strandbeest's\" here:\nhttps://www.strandbeest.com/",
