  "text": "Design as Art\n-by Bruno Munari\n\n\"Design as Art\" by Bruno Munari is a seminal work that explores the intersection of art and design. Munari, an influential Italian artist and designer, delves into how design affects everyday life and advocates for functional beauty. The book covers various topics, including typography, visual communication, and the relationship between form and function. Munariâ€™s insights encourage readers to view design not just as a profession, but as an artistic and integral part of life. Through witty commentary and thought-provoking illustrations, he challenges traditional perceptions of art and design, urging a harmonious blend of aesthetics and practicality.",
