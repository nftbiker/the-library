  "text": "Karl Gerstner, Review of 5x10 years of graphic design etc., Hatje Cantz, English edition, 2001\n\nThe exhaustive and beautifully made book shows many examples of his seminal work from 50 years of graphic design and painting, each accompanied by Gerstnerâ€™s own explanations and anecdotes. The book vividly illustrates the ups and downs of the designer's professional life. Gerstner might be the graphic designer I personally consider to be the most genius and influential. The depth and innovation in his work constantly leaves me speechless.\n\nKarl Gerstner (1930â€“2017) is regarded as one of the most important innovators in typography, commercial art and corporate design. He is one of the foremost and ground-breaking Swiss artists and graphic designers, who carefully divided his brilliance between being a painter and a graphic designer and became a pioneer in both purÂ­suits. \n\nA ðŸ§µ  â€” 1/6",
