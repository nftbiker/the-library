  "text": "Performance in Contemporary Art (2022) \nBy Catherine Wood \nPublisher: Tate Publishing, Limited\n\nUnpacking the history of performance art and celebrating the work of contemporary practitioners, a must-read for both art lovers and students alike.\nStunningly beautiful, deeply puzzling, powerfully moving, or intensely unsettling--performance art can evoke a wide variety of responses. In this important survey, Catherine Wood, one of the world's leading curators and writers in this field, provides the broadest and most up-to-date insight into the subject yet published. Wood proposes performance not as a genre separate from object-making but as a medium that has profoundly influenced the shape of contemporary art.\n\nFrom the spectacular forms of intimacy performed by Marina Abramovic to the painting processions initiated by Ei Arakawa and the social activism of Tania Bruguera, practices have emerged in the past 30 years that embrace the worlds of sculpture and painting, spectacle, and protest.\n\nSource: Publisher",
