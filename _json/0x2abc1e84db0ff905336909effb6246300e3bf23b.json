  "text": "Print Punch: Artefacts From The Punch Card Era - by Steven E Jones, Sandra Rendgen and John L Walters\n\n\"Print Punch returns to the heyday of the punch card â€” to a time when you could touch (and punch) data. The aesthetics of this early move towards automation represent a unique moment in our history, when we designed for machines instead of human beings. \n\nRigorous constraints, inherent in punch card technology, unwittingly birthed a coherent design language: rhythm in grids, punched absences and presences, and the patterns in them dancing to their own machine logic.\"\n\n208 pages\nLaser cut hardback\n240x310mm\nLimited to 700 copies\nISBN: 9781916412132\n\nhttps://patrickfry.co.uk/printpunch",
