  "text": "Peter Mendelsund \nWhat We See When We Read (Vintage Original): A Phenomenology, 2014\n\n'What do we see when we read? Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like? The collection of fragmented images on a page—a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so—and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved—or reviled—literary figures.'\n\nThis is a fun book about abstraction, perception, visualisation, and the ways in which we construct meaning and mental models from reading works of literature. \n\nA few more images below!",
