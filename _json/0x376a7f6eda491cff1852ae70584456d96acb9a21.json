  "text": "ðŸ”¥ Adding up to my Karl Gerstner book presentation yesterday, I've made an interesting discovery, that I want to share with you all:\n\nKarl Gerstner's seminal book \"Designing Programmes\", first published in 1964 and then re-released as an updated and revised version in 2007, re-worked by the designer himself and in co-operation with Harald Geisler and Jonas Pabst, is officially available as a free PDF download in 3 different language versions from Geisler's website. The printed books are quite expensive on secondary.\n\nðŸ‘‰ https://haraldgeisler.com/2020/06/20/designing-programmes-karl-gerstner/\n\nYou have to fill out a basic form and login to Geisler's website to download the PDF(s). He also asks us to not share or redistribute the PDFs, only from his official website. You can also make a donation.\n\nâ€“â€“\nPS\nA printed facsimile edition by Lars MÃ¼ller Publishers, released 2019, is available in English and German language as well.",
