  "text": "Corpus Delecti: Performance Art of the Americas (2005)\nEditor:Coco Fusco\nFormat:ebook\nPublisher:Taylor & Francis\n\n\nThe most comprehensive volume on performance art from the Americas to have appeared in English, Corpus Delecti is a unique collection of historical and critical studies of contemporary Latin performance. Drawing on live art from the 1960s to the present day, these fascinating essays explore the impact of Latin American politics, popular culture and syncretic religions on Latin performance.\nIncluding contributions by artists as well as scholars, Fusco's collection bridges the theory/practice divide and discusses a wide variety of genres. Among them are:\n* body art\n* carpa\n* vaudeville\n* staged political protest\n* tropicalist musical comedies\n* contemporary Venezuelan performance art\n* the Chicano Art movement\n* queer Latino performance\nThe essays demonstrate how specific social and historical contexts have shaped Latin American performance. \n\nSource: Publisher",
