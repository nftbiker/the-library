  "text": "How Borges Wrote - Daniel Balderston,  2018\n\nFor those who have checked out books from the Library of Babel.... \n\nThis is not a treatise on those well-known recurring themes dear to Borges or an exploration of his stylist tendencies, but a look into the way he planned his work and the process of revision he used over successive drafts in an almost procedural/combinatorial manner. It is also an investigation into the way he annotated his handwritten manuscripts with symbols as a shorthand –  and as code – for the underlying structural logic of his stories.
