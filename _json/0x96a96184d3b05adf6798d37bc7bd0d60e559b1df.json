  "text": "OFF Festival 2007 (Bcn) catalogue.\nFeaturing among others: John Maeda, Frank Bertschneider/Raster Noton, Zach Lieberman & Golan Levin.\n.\nPersonal Note: 2006&2007 OFFFestivals had a big impact in me. At the time I wast \"just\" a fresh junior graphic designer, and there I saw for the first time Interactive/Generative art / audioreactive live visuals, and decided that I wanted to explore coding and Interactive media in the future. Among others I saw talks by Robert Hodgin, Casey Reas, John Maeda. A performance with  weird interface by Golan Levin & Zach Lieberman and a RasterNoton Live AV Showcase.",
