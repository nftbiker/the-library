  "text": "Wendit Tnce Inf - by Allison Parrish\n\n2022\n4.5 x 7 inches\n28 pages\nEdition of 56\n\nPrinting: Letterpress\nBinding: Hand-sewn\n\nWendit Tnce Inf is a book of asemic prose poems, published in a hand-made letterpress-printed edition. To generate the poems, Allison trained a suite of GANs (generative adversarial networks) on bitmap images of random words, and sampled from those GANs to generate new wordforms, pixel-by-pixel. A separate program she wrote then places these words on the page, one after another, line by line, mimicking the process of typesetting English prose.\n\nhttps://www.aleator.press/releases/wendit-tnce-inf",
