i quite enjoy interior design books.   
  
this one is a kinda meta version of those books.   
  
lots of the more 'invisible' guidelines & rules & tips put down.   
  
its a book the author admits they wrote b/c they'd searched & realized it didn't exist.   
  
ive found it useful for helping me edit ideas. but very useful overall...
