Received today: Pathways by my friend @v3ga, on @vetro.   
  
A very impressive book. I might be biased, but the sheer volume of work and the documentation of Julien's creative evolution is awe-inspiring.   
  
Very special detail: The pages extend to dimensions of the cover and are shiny black on the side. Just beautiful.
