If I had to give away all my books, this would be the one to keep:  
  
Semiology of Graphics   
by French cartographer Jacques Bertin   
(original title: SÃ©miologie Graphique, 1967; here: German version, 1974)  
  
Monumental work with unmatched depth, the most comprehensive theoretical foundation for Information Visualization.
