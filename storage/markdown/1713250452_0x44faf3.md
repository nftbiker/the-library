Algorithms to Live By - Brian Christian & Tom Griffiths, 2016  
  
I found this book useful and did in fact incorporate a few of its insights into the daily running of my life - esp scheduling and certain kinds of decision making. Great chapters on everyday examples of sorting and caching algorithms, in particular.
